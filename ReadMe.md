This is my solution to the hacker rank reverse shuffle merge task, which doesn't work properly.

To recap, the idea is that you are given a string s, which is the result of Merge(Reverse(A),Shuffle(A)).  The task is to find the smallest A. Small means lexicographically smallest.

There are two tests - 4 and 13 - which I couldn't get to work as one character is wrong.  I've given up for the time being.
